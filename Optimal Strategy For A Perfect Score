The optimal strategy for getting a perfect score of no yellow or green letters in a real game simply requires using the 6 guesses:

qajaq, cocco, xylyl, kibbi, pfftt, zhuzh


This will give a perfect score if the answer is one of 22 words:
dense, dress, geese, genre, greed, green, merge,
nerve, never, newer, renew, semen, sense, serve,
seven, sever, sewer, sneer, verge, verse, verve,
wedge

The strategy is so simple because new information wont change the best guesses. Because with every guess the only acceptable result is all gray letters, anything else immediately fails.
